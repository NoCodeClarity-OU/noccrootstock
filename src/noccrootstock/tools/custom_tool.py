        Example integration steps for Rootstock smart contracts:

        1. Set up Web3.js or Ethers.js in the frontend to interact with Rootstock smart contracts:
           - Install the chosen library (Web3.js or Ethers.js)
           - Configure the provider to connect to the Rootstock network
           - Load the smart contract ABI and address

        2. Create API endpoints in the backend to serve data from Supabase:
           - Implement RESTful endpoints to fetch and update data
           - Use Supabase client library to interact with the database

        3. Implement functions in the frontend to call Rootstock smart contract methods:
           - Use Web3.js or Ethers.js to create contract instances
           - Implement functions that correspond to smart contract methods
           - Handle transaction signing and sending

        4. Set up event listeners for Rootstock smart contract events:
           - Subscribe to relevant contract events
           - Update the application state or trigger actions based on emitted events

        5. Update the UI based on smart contract interactions and backend API responses:
           - Reflect the state changes from smart contract calls in the UI
           - Display data fetched from the Supabase backend
           - Implement loading states and error handling for asynchronous operations

        6. Implement user authentication and authorization:
           - Use Supabase Auth for user management
           - Integrate with Web3 wallets for Rootstock transactions
           - Manage user sessions and permissions

        7. Optimize for performance and user experience:
           - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
           - Use WebSockets or long-polling for real-time updates
           - Provide feedback for transaction status and confirmations

        8. Ensure proper error handling and logging:
           - Implement try-catch blocks for smart contract interactions
           - Log errors and important events for debugging and monitoring
           - Provide user-friendly error messages in the UI

        The specific implementation details would depend on the project requirements, 
        the chosen frontend framework, and the complexity of the smart contracts.
